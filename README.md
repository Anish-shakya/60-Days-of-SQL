## Day 1 of 60days
- During my SQL learning journey, Today I learn about the basic introduction and Different Database language.
- Introduction : SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands and syntax for performing various operations on data stored in a database.
- SQL plays a crucial role in data analysis by providing powerful tools to retrieve, filter, aggregate, and manipulate data stored in relational databases.



| SQL | Description |Commands|
| ----------- | ----------- |-----------|
|Data Definition Language (DDL)|DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of the database, including tables, views, indexes, and constraints.| CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME.|
|Data Manipulation Language (DML)|DML commands are used to manipulate and retrieve data within the database.|SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.|
|Data Control Language (DCL)|DCL commands are used to manage user access and control database privileges.|GRANT, REVOKE|
|Transaction Control Language (TCL)|TCL commands are used to manage transactions within the database. A transaction is a sequence of database operations that should be treated as a single unit.|COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.|

## Day 2 of 60days
- During my SQL learning journey, Today I learn about the Entity Relationship Diagrams and Different type of Keys.
- An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation that depicts the entities (objects) in a database, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It helps in designing and understanding the structure of a database

| Keys | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Primary Key (PK)|A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table.|
|Foreign Key (FK)|A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.It establishes a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity|
|Composite Key|A composite key consists of two or more columns that, together, uniquely identify a record in a table|
|Candidate Key|A candidate key is a column or a set of columns that can uniquely identify a record in a table|
|Unique Key|A unique key ensures that the values in the column(s) are unique and not duplicated within a table|
|Alternate Key|An alternate key is a candidate key that was not selected as the primary key.|

## Day 3 of 60days
- During my SQL learning journey, Today I learn about the Data Definition languages and it's commands.
- Learned about how to create tables and different data types that are available to create tables and define the attributes of columns.
- DataTypes 
  - INTEGER:signed four-byte integer
  - VARCHAR(n):variable-length character string with maximum length 'n'
  - TEXT:variable-length character string without any length limit
  - CHAR(n):fixed-length character string with length 'n'

| SQL Commands| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|CREATE|This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers)|
|ALTER|This is used to alter the structure of the database.|
|DROP|This command is used to delete objects from the database.|
|TRUNCATE|This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.|
